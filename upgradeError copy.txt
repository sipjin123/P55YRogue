The project could not be compiled. Would you like to open it in Rider Uproject?

Warning: [Upgrade]
Warning: [Upgrade] Using backward-compatible build settings. The latest version of UE sets the following values by default, which may require code changes:
Warning: [Upgrade]     bLegacyParentIncludePaths = false               => Omits module parent folders from include paths to reduce compiler command line length. (Previously: true).
Warning: [Upgrade]     CppStandard = CppStandardVersion.Default        => Updates C++ Standard to C++20 (Previously: CppStandardVersion.Cpp17).
Warning: [Upgrade]     WindowsPlatform.bStrictConformanceMode = true   => Updates MSVC strict conformance mode to true (Previously: false).
Warning: [Upgrade]     bValidateFormatStrings = true                   => Enables compile-time validation of strings+args passed to UE_LOG. (Previously: false).
Warning: [Upgrade] Suppress this message by setting 'DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V5;' in P5YYEditor.Target.cs, and explicitly overriding settings that differ from the new defaults.
Warning: [Upgrade]
Warning: [Upgrade]
Warning: [Upgrade] Using backward-compatible include order. The latest version of UE has changed the order of includes, which may require code changes. The current setting is:
Warning: [Upgrade]     IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_1
Warning: [Upgrade] Suppress this message by setting 'IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;' in P5YYEditor.Target.cs.
Warning: [Upgrade] Alternatively you can set this to 'EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest' to always use the latest include order. This will potentially cause compile errors when integrating new versions of the engine.

P5YYEditor modifies the values of properties: [ bStrictConformanceMode ]. This is not allowed, as P5YYEditor has build products in common with UnrealEditor.
Remove the modified setting, change P5YYEditor to use a unique build environment by setting 'BuildEnvironment = TargetBuildEnvironment.Unique;' in the P5YYEditorTarget constructor, or set bOverrideBuildEnvironment = true to force this setting on.
